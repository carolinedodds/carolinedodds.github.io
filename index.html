			<h1> HTML Exercise </h1>
				<p>The purpose of this exercise is to put the lessons learned from previous exercises together to build a web page of your own.</p>
        <p> It's going to be fun</p>
			<h2>Previously...</h2>
		<ul>
      <li>You looked at the HTML that made up a <a href="http://edinburgh.codefirstgirls.org.uk/courses/html/sample.html">Sample Page</a></li>
      <li>You looked at the HTML that made up one of your favourite sites</li>
      <li>You changed the attribute of an img tag to change the picture it showed</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Now ...</h3>
      		<p>You should:</p>
      	<ol>
      <li>Look at the picture of this site</li>
      <li>Try and match up the look of the site to HTML that you've seen so far</li>
      <li>Now build that HTML in your own index .html page</li>
      <li>Check the page in a web browser to see how it compares</li>
      <li>Look back to the slides if you want to</li>
  		</ol>

   			 <p> Here's a picture of a cat </p>
